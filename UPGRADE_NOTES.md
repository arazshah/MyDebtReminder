# Upgrade Notes - Debt Reminder Bot

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Async/Await Issues
- **bot_handler.py**: Changed `run_bot()` method to async
- Properly implemented async bot initialization and shutdown
- Fixed event loop handling for continuous operation

### 2. Database Improvements
- **database.py**: Added automatic directory creation for database
- Ensures `data/` directory exists before database initialization
- Prevents file not found errors on first run

### 3. Dependencies Update
- **requirements.txt**: Removed unused `APScheduler` dependency
- Kept only necessary packages:
  - `python-telegram-bot==20.7`
  - `pytz==2023.3`

### 4. Project Structure Enhancements
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Created `run.sh` script for easy bot execution
- Added virtual environment support

### 5. Files Added
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `run.sh` - Automated run script
- `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` - This file

## How to Run

### Method 1: Using the run script (Recommended)
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual execution
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the bot
python main.py
```

### Method 3: Using Docker
```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the bot
docker-compose down
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Fixed async/await compatibility
- [x] Database auto-initialization
- [x] Virtual environment setup
- [x] Dependencies installation
- [x] Run script creation
- [ ] Bot startup test
- [ ] Command functionality test

## Next Steps

1. Test the bot by running: `./run.sh`
2. Send `/start` command to the bot
3. Test adding a debt with `/add_debt`
4. Test listing debts with `/list_debts`
